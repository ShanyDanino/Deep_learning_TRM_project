# NonoReason: Recursive Reasoning for Nonograms

**NonoReason** explores the potential of compact AI models to master complex logic through recursive reasoning. By mirroring the iterative way humans solve Nonogram puzzles, this project demonstrates that sophisticated intelligence can emerge from efficient, minimalist design rather than raw computing power.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI model capable of solving Nonograms—logic puzzles defined by row and column constraints. Unlike large language models that attempt to generate a solution in one go, NonoReason utilizes a **recursive reasoning architecture**. It solves the grid step-by-step, constantly cross-referencing constraints to verify and deduce the next move.

### Key Features
* **Recursive Reasoning:** Solves puzzles iteratively (step-by-step) rather than using one-shot generation.
* **Sample Efficiency:** Achieves high accuracy with a relatively small dataset (~50k examples).
* **Human-Like Process:** "Thinks" by scanning rows and columns for contradictions, similar to a human player.
* **TinyML Ready:** Designed to be lightweight and efficient, suitable for resource-constrained environments.
